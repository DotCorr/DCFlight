# DCFlight Debug Log Removal Scripts

These scripts remove debug print statements from the DCFlight codebase for production release.

## Scripts Available

### 1. `remove_debug_logs.sh` (Bash Version)
- Fast bash-based cleanup
- Uses sed and awk for pattern matching
- Good for simple cases

### 2. `remove_debug_logs.py` (Python Version) - **Recommended**
- More sophisticated parsing
- Better handling of complex nested blocks
- Safer and more reliable

## What Gets Removed

### Dart Files
- `print()` statements
- `debugPrint()` statements
- `developer.log()` statements
- `if (kDebugMode) { print() }` single-line statements
- `if (kDebugMode) { ... }` multi-line blocks

### Swift Files
- `print()` statements
- `NSLog()` statements
- `os_log()` statements
- `#if DEBUG ... #endif` blocks

## Usage

### Option 1: Python Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run from DCFlight root directory
./remove_debug_logs.py

# Or specify a different directory
./remove_debug_logs.py /path/to/dcflight
```

### Option 2: Bash Script
```bash
# Run from DCFlight root directory
./remove_debug_logs.sh
```

## Before Running

1. **Commit your current changes** to git
2. **Make sure you have a backup** of your code
3. **Review the changes** after running with `git diff`

Total debug lines removed: 34

✅ Debug log cleanup completed successfully!
💡 Tip: Run 'git diff' to review the changes before committing.
```

## What NOT to Remove

The scripts are designed to preserve:
- Error handling and production logging
- Comments containing the word "print"
- String literals containing debug statements
- Essential logging for production diagnostics

## After Running

1. **Review changes**: `git diff`
2. **Test your app** to ensure nothing broke
3. **Commit the cleanup**: `git add . && git commit -m "Remove debug logs for production"`

## Adding Debug Logs Back

When you need to debug again:
1. Add specific debug statements only where needed
2. Use `if (kDebugMode)` blocks in Dart
3. Use `#if DEBUG` blocks in Swift
4. Remove them again before release using these scripts
