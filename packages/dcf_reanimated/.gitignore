# Skia source and build directories - IGNORED
# This contains Skia source code and build artifacts (~10GB)
# Framework contributors can rebuild by running: ./scripts/rebuild_skia_simulator.sh
# Regular developers DON'T need this - they use the pre-built library below
ios/Skia/source/
ios/Skia/build/

# Skia compiled library and headers ARE COMMITTED (via Git LFS)
# Regular developers get these automatically - NO BUILDING NEEDED!
# Architecture-specific files (each under 2GB GitHub limit):
#   - ios/Skia/lib/libskia_x86_64.a (619MB) - iOS Simulator
#   - ios/Skia/lib/libskia_arm64.a (997MB) - iOS Device (standard)
#   - ios/Skia/lib/libskia_arm64e.a (1.0GB) - iOS Device (newer Apple Silicon)
# Combined library (libskia.a) is generated automatically during pod install
# DO NOT COMMIT - it's created from the split files
ios/Skia/lib/libskia.a
# ios/Skia/include/ - COMMITTED (headers, regular git)
