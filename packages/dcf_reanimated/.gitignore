# Skia build directory (30GB) - IGNORED
# This contains Skia source code and build artifacts
# Framework contributors can rebuild by running: ./scripts/setup_skia.sh
# Regular developers DON'T need this - they use the pre-built library below
ios/Skia/build/

# Skia compiled library and headers ARE COMMITTED (via Git LFS)
# Regular developers get these automatically - NO BUILDING NEEDED!
# ios/Skia/lib/libskia.a - COMMITTED (2GB, via Git LFS)
# ios/Skia/include/ - COMMITTED (headers, regular git)
